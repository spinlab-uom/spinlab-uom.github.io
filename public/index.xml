      <description>Left to right: Varun, Georgia, Caroline, Anna, and Shruti. We will need a new team photo as the lab has already grown since this was taken!
We are a research group based at the Univerity of Manchester interested in mechanisms of brain plasticity during neurodevelopment. We use a combination of advanced brain imaging and computational methods to understand how brain plasticity is altered in certain genetic conditions and how that affects learning.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two lab members presented their research at the 2024 Global NF Conference in Brussels, hosted by the Children’s Tumor Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamze&amp;rsquo;s study explored whether parent-infant interactions (PII) differ in infants with an increased likelihood of ADHD and infants with NF1 compared to typically developing infants at 10 and 14 months. The findings provide preliminary insights into the quality of PII in these groups, suggesting distinct interaction profiles. For NF1 infants, this is characterised mainly by mutuality, a tendency of lower parental sensitivity, and higher directiveness. For infants with elevated ADHD likelihood, the profile includes higher liveliness and lower negative affect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sadali attended the 2024 ICIS conference held in Glasgow, where she was was part of a symposium that discussed Early Pathways to Neurodiversity in infants with an elevated likelihood of Autism Spectrum Condition and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The symposium was composed of our collaborator Dr Jannath Begum Ali from Birkbeck, University of London, Natasha Lindsay and Dr Amy Goodwin from Kings College London. Sadali&amp;rsquo;s talk focused on early motor markers of ADHD traits in Neurofibromatosis 1. In this presentation, she discussed preliminary findings from a comparative analysis conducted between three 10- and 14- month old cohorts i.e., infants with NF1, typically developing infants and infants with an elevated likelihood of primary ADHD. This analysis incorporated motor data collected using accelerometery and standardised motor assessment scale metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

Exploring how eye movements and pupil response during learning relate to neurotransmission: A combined neuroimaging and eye tracking study
About the Project Glutamate and GABA are two important neurotransmitters in the brain. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter, while GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glutamate and GABA work together to maintain a balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain, which is essential for normal cognitive function.</description>

      <description>In our latest computational paper we investigate plasticity dynamics in a WC-based model of interacting neural populations coupled with activity-dependent synapses in which a periodic stimulation was applied in the presence of noise of controlled intensity. We found that for a narrow range of the noise variance, synaptic strength can be optimized. In particular, there is a regime of noise intensity for which synaptic strength presents a triple-stable state. Regulating noise intensity affects the probability that the system chooses one of the stable states, thereby controlling plasticity.</description>

      <description>In our latest paper we test the hypothesis that fMRS detects shifts in metabolite concentrations as they move from presynaptic vesicles, where they are largely invisible to MRS, to extracellular and cytosolic pools, where they are visible to MRS using a mean field model which links the neural dynamics of neurotransmitters at the microscopic-level to the macroscopic-level imaging measurements obtained in experimental studies.

      <description>I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience with a background in engineering and theoretical physics. My research includes providing mathematical framework to optimise the parameters of non-invasive brain stimulations with the purpose of improving Working Memory.
More specifically, I am interested in bridging between empirical data and computational models of large-scale brain networks by drawing implications from latent manifold of neuroimaging data. With insights from dynamical systems and complex system physics, I seek to put constraints on computational models of brain networks using the embedding and intrinsic dimension of Working Memory manifold.</description>

      <description>I studied an integrated Masters in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of Manchester from 2019 until 2023. Here, I developed an interest in neuroimaging and undertook MRI and fMRI analysis projects in my 3rd and 4th year. This included my yearlong master’s project, employing fMRI analysis to examine negativity biases in depression when listening to music. Currently, I am working as a PhD student in the SpiN-LAB.</description>

      <description>I have joined the Spin-Lab in September 2023 as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Neuroimaging and Computational Modelling. I have a background in undergraduate Psychology, where I developed an interest in neural basis of executive function, language, perception and wellbeing. I pursued my interests further with a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Neuroimaging for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience and followed by pursuit of a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience. During my Ph.D. I investigated how the relationship between structural and functional connectivity of the brain contributes to modelling of cognition.</description>

Postdoctoral Research Associate- Faculty of biology, medicine and health, University of Manchester
I completed my doctoral study in Neurosciences at the University of Reading. My doctoral research was aimed to investigate the neural correlates of autistic traits across the clinical and non-clinical population using a dimensional approach. To address this, I used multimodal brain imaging techniques including Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Structural MRI, and resting-state functional MRI to examine the white matter microstructure, grey matter (cortical volume, thickness, surface area and gyrification), and intrinsic functional connectivity (resting state networks).</description>
