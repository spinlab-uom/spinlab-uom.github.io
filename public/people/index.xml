      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did my general medical training at Grant Medical College, Mumbai India beofre training in general psychiatry at Oxford &amp;amp; Leeds. I moved to Manchester in 2008 to specialise in Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry. I was awarded a research training fellowship by NIHR Bioedical Research centre in 2011-12 to study the behavioural phenotype of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). My PhD thesis described for the first time, a high prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in NF1. This work has formed the basis for my research programme in NF1 autism. In August 2018 I was awarded the Francis Collins Scholarship in NF1 by NTAP (Neurofibromatosis Therapeutics Acceleration Program), at John&amp;rsquo;s Hopkins University (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.n-tap.org/new-research-tools-for-neurofibromatosis-type-1-2-2-2/)&#34;&gt;http://www.n-tap.org/new-research-tools-for-neurofibromatosis-type-1-2-2-2/)&lt;/a&gt;. This work will allow me to investigate the use of non-invasive brain stimulation for working memory deficits in NF1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience with a background in engineering and theoretical physics. My research focuses on developing mathematical frameworks to optimise non-invasive brain stimulation parameters with the goal of enhancing working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I am interested in integrating empirical neuroimaging data with computational models of large-scale brain networks by leveraging insights from latent manifolds. Using tools from dynamical systems theory and complex systems physics, I aim to characterise the mathematical principles underlying working-memory dynamics and identify ways to modulate and improve these cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I studied an integrated Masters in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of Manchester from 2019 until 2023. Here, I developed an interest in neuroimaging and undertook MRI and fMRI analysis projects in my 3rd and 4th year. This included my yearlong master’s project, employing fMRI analysis to examine negativity biases in depression when listening to music. Currently, I am working as a PhD student in the SpiN-LAB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gamze Kaplan, MA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Postgraduate Researcher - Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After completing my undergraduate degree in Special Education, I pursued a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Early Childhood Education at Anglia Ruskin University. During my time there, I conducted research on the experiences of first-generation immigrant parents while accessing early intervention services for their children with disabilities. Currently, I am a PhD researcher in the Division of Psychology at the University of Manchester. My project focuses on studying the psychological impact of NF1 on both children and parents. Specifically, I am exploring how expectant parents with NF1 experience pregnancy, and the parent-infant interaction patterns of infants with NF1 and familial ADHD likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have joined the Spin-Lab in September 2023 as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Neuroimaging and Computational Modelling. I have a background in undergraduate Psychology, where I developed an interest in neural basis of executive function, language, perception and wellbeing. I pursued my interests further with a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Neuroimaging for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience and followed by pursuit of a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience. During my Ph.D. I investigated how the relationship between structural and functional connectivity of the brain contributes to modelling of cognition. My current research focuses on modelling effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on functional connectivity during working memory in neurofirbromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurotypical controls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my undergraduate studies in Psychology and my master&amp;rsquo;s in Neuroimaging for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience, I developed a strong interest in the neural mechanisms of memory. Currently, as an MRC-DTP PhD student, I am investigating the relationship between pupillary response, brain activation, and concentrations of GABA and glutamate during learning and memory processes in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) as well as neurotypical controls.

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a BSc Neuroscience student completing an Industrial Placement at the SPIN  lab. My primary research project is titled ‘Comparing BOLD fMRI activation in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), Default Mode Network (DMN) and Fronto-Parietal Control Network (FPCN) in NF1 patients and controls, during a Verbal Working Memory Task’. Through this project I gained experience in cognitive data collection, data analysis, data management, project management and have obtained experience using MATLAB’s SPM for fMRI analysis. My current supervisors are Dr Marta Czime Litwińczuk and Dr Shruti Garg.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following completion of my undergraduate degree in Nursing Studies (Mental Health) I worked as a Mental Health Nurse for 14 years in a variety of NHS services- primarily working with Children and Young People.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During this time, I developed a keen interest in research informed practice and cognitive neuroscience, completing a MSc in Clinical Cognitive Neuroscience in 2019. I am particularly interested in contributing to our understanding of mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions and how this knowledge can then be translated to drive successful outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am an MRC-DTP student studying a PhD in cognitive neuroscience under the supervision of Dr Shruti Garg and Professor Jonathan Green. I completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Medical Sciences at University College London following which I did a Master of Research in neuroscience at the University of St Andrews. During my masters, I investigated the impact of optogenetic neuromodulation on locomotion in Drosophila Melanogaster larvae which prompted my interest in motor function. I am currently investigating early neurophysiological and motor markers of ADHD traits in NF1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I graduated with an MBChB(Hons) from the University of Liverpool in 2013 and gained MRCP(UK) in 2017. I completed the UK foundation programme and core medical training in Merseyside and South Yorkshire, respectively. Following on from this, I undertook an MSc in Human and Molecular Genetics at the University of Sheffield and began higher specialty training in Clinical Genetics in 2020. I have temporarily paused this role to undertake a Clinical Doctoral Fellowship funded by the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), under the primary supervision of Dr Shruti Garg.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My doctoral research was aimed to investigate the neural correlates of autistic traits across the clinical and non-clinical population using a dimensional approach. To address this, I used multimodal brain imaging techniques including Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Structural MRI, and resting-state functional MRI to examine the white matter microstructure, grey matter (cortical volume, thickness, surface area and gyrification), and intrinsic functional connectivity (resting state networks).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
