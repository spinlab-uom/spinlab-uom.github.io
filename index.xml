&lt;p>I did my general medical training at Grant Medical College, Mumbai India beofre training in general psychiatry at Oxford &amp;amp; Leeds. I moved to Manchester in 2008 to specialise in Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry. I was awarded a research training fellowship by NIHR Bioedical Research centre in 2011-12 to study the behavioural phenotype of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). My PhD thesis described for the first time, a high prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in NF1. This work has formed the basis for my research programme in NF1 autism. In August 2018 I was awarded the Francis Collins Scholarship in NF1 by NTAP (Neurofibromatosis Therapeutics Acceleration Program), at John&amp;rsquo;s Hopkins University (&lt;a href="http://www.n-tap.org/new-research-tools-for-neurofibromatosis-type-1-2-2-2/)">http://www.n-tap.org/new-research-tools-for-neurofibromatosis-type-1-2-2-2/)&lt;/a>. This work will allow me to investigate the use of non-invasive brain stimulation for working memory deficits in NF1.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SPiN-LAB attend 2025 BNA conference in Liverpool</title><link>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>The SPiN-LAB had a great turnout for BNA 2025 in Liverpool with plenty of posters on display from the group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Gamze&amp;rsquo;s study explored whether parent-infant interactions (PII) differ in infants with an increased likelihood of ADHD and infants with NF1 compared to typically developing infants at 10 and 14 months. The findings provide preliminary insights into the quality of PII in these groups, suggesting distinct interaction profiles. For NF1 infants, this is characterised mainly by mutuality, a tendency of lower parental sensitivity, and higher directiveness. For infants with elevated ADHD likelihood, the profile includes higher liveliness and lower negative affect.&lt;/p>

The symposium was composed of our collaborator Dr Jannath Begum Ali from Birkbeck, University of London, Natasha Lindsay and Dr Amy Goodwin from Kings College London. Sadali&amp;rsquo;s talk focused on early motor markers of ADHD traits in Neurofibromatosis 1. In this presentation, she discussed preliminary findings from a comparative analysis conducted between three 10- and 14- month old cohorts i.e., infants with NF1, typically developing infants and infants with an elevated likelihood of primary ADHD. This analysis incorporated motor data collected using accelerometery and standardised motor assessment scale metrics.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exploring how eye movements and pupil response during learning relate to neurotransmission: A combined neuroimaging and eye tracking study&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About the Project
Glutamate and GABA are two important neurotransmitters in the brain. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter, while GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glutamate and GABA work together to maintain a balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain, which is essential for normal cognitive function. Imbalance in glutamate and GABA levels has been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders and may underlie cognitive impairments (e.g., learning and memory disturbance) associated with these conditions. At the same time, oculomotor behaviour (eye movements) has been linked to memory encoding and retrieval processes, while an important physiological indicator of cognitive and memory processing is the pupillary response, which reflects the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Previous studies (see e.g., Kafkas, 2021) have shown that variations in pupillary responses in memory tasks are linked to differential neurotransmission in the brain and especially within prefrontal and hippocampal pathways, which are involved in memory formation and consolidation. However, to date, the degree to which glutamate and GABA neurotransmission modulates oculomotor and pupillary responses in learning and memory tasks has not been investigated. This kind of association may provide a novel biomarker for cognitive/memory function and will allow understanding of the mechanisms that result in cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Paper: A Targeted, Low-Throughput Compound Screen in a Drosophila Model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Identifies Simvastatin and BMS-204352 as Potential Therapies for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</title><link>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Check out our latest paper:&lt;/p>

We found that for a narrow range of the noise variance, synaptic strength can be optimized. In particular, there is a regime of noise intensity for which synaptic strength presents a triple-stable state. Regulating noise intensity affects the probability that the system chooses one of the stable states, thereby controlling plasticity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Paper: A mean-field model of glutamate and GABA synaptic dynamics for functional MRS</title><link>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>In our latest paper we test the hypothesis that fMRS detects shifts in metabolite concentrations as they move from presynaptic vesicles, where they are largely invisible to MRS, to extracellular and cytosolic pools, where they are visible to MRS using a mean field model which links the neural dynamics of neurotransmitters at the microscopic-level to the macroscopic-level imaging measurements obtained in experimental studies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience with a background in engineering and theoretical physics. My research includes providing mathematical framework to optimise the parameters of non-invasive brain stimulations with the purpose of improving Working Memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More specifically, I am interested in bridging between empirical data and computational models of large-scale brain networks by drawing implications from latent manifold of neuroimaging data. With insights from dynamical systems and complex system physics, I seek to put constraints on computational models of brain networks using the embedding and intrinsic dimension of Working Memory manifold.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anna Wild</title><link>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/people/anna/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/people/anna/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;p>I have joined the Spin-Lab in September 2023 as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Neuroimaging and Computational Modelling. I have a background in undergraduate Psychology, where I developed an interest in neural basis of executive function, language, perception and wellbeing. I pursued my interests further with a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Neuroimaging for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience and followed by pursuit of a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience. During my Ph.D. I investigated how the relationship between structural and functional connectivity of the brain contributes to modelling of cognition.

&lt;p>I completed my doctoral study in Neurosciences at the University of Reading. My doctoral research was aimed to investigate the neural correlates of autistic traits across the clinical and non-clinical population using a dimensional approach. To address this, I used multimodal brain imaging techniques including Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Structural MRI, and resting-state functional MRI to examine the white matter microstructure, grey matter (cortical volume, thickness, surface area and gyrification), and intrinsic functional connectivity (resting state networks).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
