&lt;p>Gamze&amp;rsquo;s study explored whether parent-infant interactions (PII) differ in infants with an increased likelihood of ADHD and infants with NF1 compared to typically developing infants at 10 and 14 months. The findings provide preliminary insights into the quality of PII in these groups, suggesting distinct interaction profiles. For NF1 infants, this is characterised mainly by mutuality, a tendency of lower parental sensitivity, and higher directiveness. For infants with elevated ADHD likelihood, the profile includes higher liveliness and lower negative affect.&lt;/p>

The symposium was composed of our collaborator Dr Jannath Begum Ali from Birkbeck, University of London, Natasha Lindsay and Dr Amy Goodwin from Kings College London as well as myself. My talk focused on early motor markers of ADHD traits in Neurofibromatosis 1.</description></item><item><title>New paper: Rhythmic modulation of subthalamo-pallidal interactions depends on synaptic rewiring through inhibitory plasticity</title><link>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-9/</guid><description>&lt;p>Check out our latest preprint where we model inhibitory synaptic plasticity in the STN-GPe loop!&lt;/p>

Exploring how eye movements and pupil response during learning relate to neurotransmission: A combined neuroimaging and eye tracking study
About the Project Glutamate and GABA are two important neurotransmitters in the brain. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter, while GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glutamate and GABA work together to maintain a balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain, which is essential for normal cognitive function.</description></item><item><title>New Paper: A Targeted, Low-Throughput Compound Screen in a Drosophila Model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Identifies Simvastatin and BMS-204352 as Potential Therapies for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</title><link>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-3/</guid><description>Check out our latest paper:

We found that for a narrow range of the noise variance, synaptic strength can be optimized. In particular, there is a regime of noise intensity for which synaptic strength presents a triple-stable state. Regulating noise intensity affects the probability that the system chooses one of the stable states, thereby controlling plasticity.</description></item><item><title>New Paper: A mean-field model of glutamate and GABA synaptic dynamics for functional MRS</title><link>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spinlab-uom.github.io/news/news-5/</guid><description>In our latest paper we test the hypothesis that fMRS detects shifts in metabolite concentrations as they move from presynaptic vesicles, where they are largely invisible to MRS, to extracellular and cytosolic pools, where they are visible to MRS using a mean field model which links the neural dynamics of neurotransmitters at the microscopic-level to the macroscopic-level imaging measurements obtained in experimental studies.
