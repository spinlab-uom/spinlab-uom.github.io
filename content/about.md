We are a research group based at the Univerity of Manchester interested in mechanisms of brain plasticity during neurodevelopment. We use a combination of advanced brain imaging and computational methods to understand how brain plasticity is altered in certain genetic conditions and how that affects learning.

There is a translational focus to our work where we examine the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory identified in animal models in human clinical cohorts, thereby addressing a critical translational gap form animal models to humans.

Our aim is to develop optimal, personalised pharmacological and non-invasive brain stimulation treatments for the amelioration of learning difficulties in children with rare genetic conditions.
