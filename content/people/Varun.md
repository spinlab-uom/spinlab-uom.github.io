Currently, I work as a postdoctoral research associate for a study titled ‘Neuroimaging in Rasopathies’ (funded by NIHR-BRC) at the faculty of biology, medicine and health, University of Manchester, United Kingdom. In the current research project, we examine the inhibitory/excitatory imbalance associated with GABA/glutamate, functional connectivity and myelin differences underpinning learning and working memory difficulties in children with Rasopathies specifically including Neurofibromatosis type-I and Noonan Syndrome as well as its phenotypic relationship with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). I completed my doctoral study in Neurosciences at the University of Reading. My doctoral research was aimed to investigate the neural correlates of autistic traits across the clinical and non-clinical population using a dimensional approach.
