Varun Arunachalam Chandran, PhD 

Postdoctoral Research Associate- Faculty of biology, medicine and health, University of Manchester

I completed my doctoral study in Neurosciences at the University of Reading. My doctoral research was aimed to investigate the neural correlates of autistic traits across the clinical and non-clinical population using a dimensional approach. To address this, I used multimodal brain imaging techniques including Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Structural MRI, and resting-state functional MRI to examine the white matter microstructure, grey matter (cortical volume, thickness, surface area and gyrification), and intrinsic functional connectivity (resting state networks). 

Currently, I work as a postdoctoral research associate in the SPiN-LAB (funded by NIHR-BRC). In the current research project, I am focussed on myelin differences underpinning learning and working memory difficulties in children with Rasopathies including Neurofibromatosis type-I (NF1) and Noonan Syndrome as well as its phenotypic relationship with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). Myelin is a lipid-rich layer covering the axons and plays an important role in information processing and working memory. However, the myelin differences in neurodevelopmental conditions like Autism Spectrum Conditions, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Neurofibromatosis type-1 affects the information processing speed and leads to working memory deficits in school-aged children with NF1. To understand the myelin neurobiology in NF1, we use quantitative MRI techniques including Magnetisation Transfer Ratio (MTR) and T1W/T2W ratio to assess the grey and white matter myelin.
