I graduated with an MBChB(Hons) from the University of Liverpool in 2013 and gained MRCP(UK) in 2017. I completed the UK foundation programme and core medical training in Merseyside and South Yorkshire, respectively. Following on from this, I undertook an MSc in Human and Molecular Genetics at the University of Sheffield and began higher specialty training in Clinical Genetics in 2020. I have temporarily paused this role to undertake a Clinical Doctoral Fellowship funded by the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), under the primary supervision of Dr Shruti Garg.

I am passionate about rare genetic conditions and mental health. I am interested in a rare genetic condition called Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that causes nerve tumours and a wide range of health problems. My core PhD project involves conducting a national matched NF1 cohort study in England by utilising routinely collected health data from primary and secondary care in the NHS. Through my PhD research, I aim to uncover new insights into the natural history, mental health outcomes, and clinical care of NF1, ultimately aiming to enhance care and support for individuals affected by this rare condition.
