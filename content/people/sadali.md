I am an MRC-DTP student studying a PhD in cognitive neuroscience under the supervision of Dr Shruti Garg and Professor Jonathan Green. I completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Medical Sciences at University College London following which I did a Master of Research in neuroscience at the University of St Andrews. During my masters, I investigated the impact of optogenetic neuromodulation on locomotion in Drosophila Melanogaster larvae which prompted my interest in motor function. I am currently investigating early neurophysiological and motor markers of ADHD traits in NF1.
