Following completion of my undergraduate degree in Nursing Studies (Mental Health) I worked as a Mental Health Nurse for 14 years in a variety of NHS services- primarily working with Children and Young People. 

 

During this time, I developed a keen interest in research informed practice and cognitive neuroscience, completing a MSc in Clinical Cognitive Neuroscience in 2019. I am particularly interested in contributing to our understanding of mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions and how this knowledge can then be translated to drive successful outcomes. 

 

Currently I am completing my PhD alongside working as a Senior Research Nurse. My project utilises a novel bio-marker battery to explore the effect of a new physical health intervention on neurocognitive and mental health outcomes in the NF1 population.
