I am a BSc Neuroscience student completing an Industrial Placement at the SPIN  lab. My primary research project is titled ‘Comparing BOLD fMRI activation in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), Default Mode Network (DMN) and Fronto-Parietal Control Network (FPCN) in NF1 patients and controls, during a Verbal Working Memory Task’. Through this project I gained experience in cognitive data collection, data analysis, data management, project management and have obtained experience using MATLAB’s SPM for fMRI analysis. My current supervisors are Dr Marta Czime Litwińczuk and Dr Shruti Garg. 

I’m excited to continue working in the lab as part of the FCS 2024 Summer Studentship Program! This project will be done under further supervision from Dr Shruti Garg and PhD student Sadali Waniarachchi.
