During my undergraduate studies in Psychology and my master's in Neuroimaging for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience, I developed a strong interest in the neural mechanisms of memory. Currently, as an MRC-DTP PhD student, I am investigating the relationship between pupillary response, brain activation, and concentrations of GABA and glutamate during learning and memory processes in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) as well as neurotypical controls.
