I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience with a background in engineering and theoretical physics. My research includes providing mathematical framework to optimise the parameters of non-invasive brain stimulations with the purpose of improving Working Memory.

More specifically, I am interested in bridging between empirical data and computational models of large-scale brain networks by drawing implications from latent manifold of neuroimaging data. With insights from dynamical systems and complex system physics, I seek to put constraints on computational models of brain networks using the embedding and intrinsic dimension of Working Memory manifold.
