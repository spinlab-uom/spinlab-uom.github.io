I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience with a background in engineering and theoretical physics. My research focuses on developing mathematical frameworks to optimise non-invasive brain stimulation parameters with the goal of enhancing working memory.

More broadly, I am interested in integrating empirical neuroimaging data with computational models of large-scale brain networks by leveraging insights from latent manifolds. Using tools from dynamical systems theory and complex systems physics, I aim to characterise the mathematical principles underlying working-memory dynamics and identify ways to modulate and improve these cognitive processes.
