I did my general medical training at Grant Medical College, Mumbai India beofre training in general psychiatry at Oxford & Leeds. I moved to Manchester in 2008 to specialise in Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. I was awarded a research training fellowship by NIHR Bioedical Research centre in 2011-12 to study the behavioural phenotype of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). My PhD thesis described for the first time, a high prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in NF1. This work has formed the basis for my research programme in NF1 autism. In August 2018 I was awarded the Francis Collins Scholarship in NF1 by NTAP (Neurofibromatosis Therapeutics Acceleration Program), at John's Hopkins University (http://www.n-tap.org/new-research-tools-for-neurofibromatosis-type-1-2-2-2/). This work will allow me to investigate the use of non-invasive brain stimulation for working memory deficits in NF1. 

Clinically I run the regional Social Development Clinic and a specialist NF1 liaison service at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.
