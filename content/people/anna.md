I studied an integrated Masters in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of Manchester from 2019 until 2023. Here, I developed an interest in neuroimaging and undertook MRI and fMRI analysis projects in my 3rd and 4th year. This included my yearlong masterâ€™s project, employing fMRI analysis to examine negativity biases in depression when listening to music. Currently, I am working as a PhD student in the SpiN-LAB.
