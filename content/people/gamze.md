Gamze Kaplan, MA

Postgraduate Researcher - Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester

After completing my undergraduate degree in Special Education, I pursued a master's degree in Early Childhood Education at Anglia Ruskin University. During my time there, I conducted research on the experiences of first-generation immigrant parents while accessing early intervention services for their children with disabilities. Currently, I am a PhD researcher in the Division of Psychology at the University of Manchester. My project focuses on studying the psychological impact of NF1 on both children and parents. Specifically, I am exploring how expectant parents with NF1 experience pregnancy, and the parent-infant interaction patterns of infants with NF1 and familial ADHD likelihood. 

Alongside my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience over the past seven years in supporting children with neurodevelopmental conditions and their parents. Currently, I am working as a teaching assistant in different modules in the Division of Psychology and Mental Health.
