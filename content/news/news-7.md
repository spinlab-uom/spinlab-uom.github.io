Two lab members presented their research at the 2024 Global NF Conference in Brussels, hosted by the Childrenâ€™s Tumor Foundation. 

Gamze's study explored whether parent-infant interactions (PII) differ in infants with an increased likelihood of ADHD and infants with NF1 compared to typically developing infants at 10 and 14 months. The findings provide preliminary insights into the quality of PII in these groups, suggesting distinct interaction profiles. For NF1 infants, this is characterised mainly by mutuality, a tendency of lower parental sensitivity, and higher directiveness. For infants with elevated ADHD likelihood, the profile includes higher liveliness and lower negative affect.

Czime is using DCM to uncover differences in effective connectivity between NF1 adolescents and controls during a working memory task. Czime's poster was nominated for a prize - well done Czime and Gamze!
