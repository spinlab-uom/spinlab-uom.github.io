### What is this study about

In this study, we’ll be using different tests to see how MEK inhibitors (MEKi -a medicine taken for some of the physical symptoms of NF1) affect learning, attention and mood in children with NF1. 

<!--more-->

### Why is this study being done? 

Children with NF1 are more likely to have some trouble with learning, memory and/or paying attention than their classmates.  Right now, we don’t fully understand why this is and there aren’t any treatments that specifically help with these problems in NF1. We hope this study will help us understand more about how the brain works in NF1, and one day lead to new treatments made just for these difficulties .

### What are we doing?

We are going to work with young people and their families who are just starting to take MEKi to explore the impact of the medication on different aspects of the brain and body. 

### How will we do this?

We will use a variety of methods including:
- EEG
- Eye-tracking
- Questionnaires
- Brain games

Some young people will also have their blood looked at and can take part in a conversation with researchers about any changes they’ve noticed after taking the medication for a few months.

### Who can take part?

We are looking for young people and their families under the age of 18 who are about to start taking MEK inhibitors.
Young people who have been taking MEKi for under a year are welcome to take part in the conversation about the medication if they would like (but wouldn’t be able to do the other parts).

### Study Timeline

This study is currently recruiting, and it is expected to run until spring 2027.
