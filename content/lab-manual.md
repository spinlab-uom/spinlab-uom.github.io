### Open Science

Open publications

It is our lab policy to use pre-prints unless this is not possible. We aim to submit pre-prints simultaneously with the initial submission to the journal. Pre-prints are updated with every major revision to the manuscript that comes as a result of the reviews. We publish open-access whenever possible and always abide by UK research funders rules about making papers publicly available.

Open code

All computational code should be freely available on the GitHub or similar at the time of publication.

Open data

Data should be shared on a public repository at the time of publication.
